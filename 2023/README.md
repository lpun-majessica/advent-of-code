# Advent of Code 2023

I recently got introduced to this event and felt hooked immediately since I always want to learn and improve my skills through challenges. It's also a great way to countdown to Christmas so it's a win-win for me :D I don't expect myself to be able to solve every puzzle right off the bat ~~or ever~~, I just think it would be cool to see how much I improve over the years and this is one way to keep track of that.
