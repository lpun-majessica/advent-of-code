# Advent of Code

This is a place for me to post all of my ***Python*** codes for :sparkles::christmas_tree: <code>Advent of Code</code> :christmas_tree::sparkles:

<code>Advent of Code</code> is a programming version of **advent calendars** which a new puzzle. with increasing difficulty, is released everyday from 1st to 25th Dec as a way for everybody to countdown until Christmas. Each puzzle has 2 parts, you earn 1 star (`*`) for each part you have answered correctly, part-2 (generally more challenging) can only be accessed once the exact answer for part-1 has been submitted.

Right on the first day of December 2023, my boss invited our team to do AoC for fun, and I got hooked ever since. I plan to do it every year to see how far I have come each year :)
